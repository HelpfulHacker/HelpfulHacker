This encryptor was made by me, a 13 year old amateur self taught coder. So you can imagine it is really bad.
It took an idiot like me 1 Hour to crack the formula and hack the code, and i am still working on an encryptor for 
JavaScript. It would probobly take a trained hacker 10 to 15 minuites to hack this encryption. But thats 10 minuites 
more than without the encryptor! Use this power wisely. IT CAN BE COMPILED MORE THAN ONCE FOR MORE SECURITY!!!
